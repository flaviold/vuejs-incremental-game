# Incremental game using Vue.js
This project was made with the purpose of fun and learning. Feel free to fork it or open an issue to complain about how unbalanced the game is.

#### Basic steps to start your modifications
1. [Install sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) 
2. Run sass to watch your `scss` changes:
```bash
sass --watch scss/main.scss css/styles.css
```
3. Testing:
A simple drag and drop of the index into the browser would be enough. I use the [simple-autoreload-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/simple-autoreload-server). It's not perfect, but it comes in handy.
